abstract ={bandit問題ではポリシーが経時変化するadaptiveな手法であるため，従来の独立性に依拠した極限定理に基づいた手法は適用出来ない．その上，重点的に選択されなかったarmについては極めてサンプル数が少なくなることが多いため，正規近似の手法も適用できない．これに対して，元々はジャンプを持つ拡散過程の汎関数の分布の漸近展開を計算するために用いられたパーシャルミキシング過程についての後ろ向き漸近展開とその正当性を導入して解決した．さらに，ランダム関数のbackward propagation (?)に対応するための手法の拡張も論じる．また，数値実験による手法の有効性も確認した．この手法は，一般のadaptiveにデザインされた，非線型なパラメータを持つ可微分な模型に応用可能である．}

The yield corresponding to only one variety will be observed on any given plot, but through an urn model embodying sampling without replacement from this doubly indexed array, Neyman obtains a formula for the variance of the difference between the averages of the observed yields of two varieties. This variance involves the variance over all plots of the potential yields and the correlation coefficient $r$ between the potential yields of the two varieties on the same plot. Since it is impossible to estimate $r$ directly, Neyman advises taking $r = 1$, observing that in practice this may lead to using too large an estimated standard deviation, when comparing two variety means.},

    abstract = {The task of estimating causal effects from non-experimental data is notoriously difficult and unreliable. Nevertheless, precisely such estimates are commonly required in many fields including economics and social science, where controlled experiments are often impossible. Linear causal models (structural equation models), combined with an implicit normality (Gaussianity) assumption on the data, provide a widely used framework for this task. We have recently described how non-Gaussianity in the data can be exploited for estimating causal effects. In this paper we show that, with non-Gaussian data, causal inference is possible even in the presence of hidden variables (unobserved confounders), even when the existence of such variables is unknown a priori. Thus, we provide a comprehensive and complete framework for the estimation of causal effects between the observed variables in the linear, non-Gaussian domain. Numerical simulations demonstrate the practical implementation of the proposed method, with full Matlab code available for all simulations.}

 abstract = {We develop results on geometric ergodicity of Markov chains and apply these and other recent results in Markov chain theory to multidimensional Hastings and Metropolis algorithms. For those based on random walk candidate distributions, we find sufficient conditions for moments and moment generating functions to converge at a geometric rate to a prescribed distribution π. By phrasing the conditions in terms of the curvature of the densities we show that the results apply to all distributions with positive densities in a large class which encompasses many commonly-used statistical forms. From these results we develop central limit theorems for the Metropolis algorithm. Converse results, showing non-geometric convergence rates for chains where the rejection rate is not bounded away from unity, are also given; these show that the negative-definiteness property is not redundant.},

    abstract = {The key distinguishing property of a Bayesian approach is marginalization, rather than using a single setting of weights. Bayesian marginalization can particularly improve the accuracy and calibration of modern deep neural networks, which are typically underspecified by the data, and can represent many compelling but different solutions. We show that deep ensembles provide an effective mechanism for approximate Bayesian marginalization, and propose a related approach that further improves the predictive distribution by marginalizing within basins of attraction, without significant overhead. We also investigate the prior over functions implied by a vague distribution over neural network weights, explaining the generalization properties of such models from a probabilistic perspective. From this perspective, we explain results that have been presented as mysterious and distinct to neural network generalization, such as the ability to fit images with random labels, and show that these results can be reproduced with Gaussian processes. We also show that Bayesian model averaging alleviates double descent, resulting in monotonic performance improvements with increased flexibility.},

	abstract = {We develop Markov categories as a framework for synthetic probability and statistics, following work of Golubtsov as well as Cho and Jacobs. This means that we treat the following concepts in purely abstract categorical terms: conditioning and disintegration; various versions of conditional independence and its standard properties; conditional products; almost surely; sufficient statistics; versions of theorems on sufficient statistics due to Fisher--Neyman, Basu, and Bahadur. Besides the conceptual clarity offered by our categorical setup, its main advantage is that it provides a uniform treatment of various types of probability theory, including discrete probability theory, measure-theoretic probability with general measurable spaces, Gaussian probability, stochastic processes of either of these kinds, and many others.},
